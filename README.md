# Lid driven cavity

I implemented a simple code to simulate the lid-driven cavity experiment using the stream-function/vorticity formulation to model the flow. Additionally, I incorporated solutal and thermal dispersion into the model.

The model considers vorticity, stream-function, temperature, and concentration for the steady state of the lid-driven cavity problem, taking into account Reynolds, Prandtl, Schmidt, and Richardson numbers, as well as the Buoyant Ratio Number.

The comparison of the variations in these numbers was presented in a paper available in this repository.
